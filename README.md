[Best Python Data Viz Libraries](https://www.fusioncharts.com/blog/best-python-data-visualization-libraries/)

### [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

The versatility of Matplotlib can be used to make many visualization types:

- Scatter plots
- Bar charts and Histograms
- Line plots
- Pie charts
- Stem plots
- Contour plots
- Quiver plots
- Spectrograms

## [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Seaborn is a popular data visualization library that is built on top of Matplotlib. Seaborn’s default styles and color palettes are much more sophisticated than Matplotlib. Beyond that, Seaborn is a higher-level library, meaning it’s easier to generate certain kinds of plots, including heat maps, time series, and violin plots.

## [ggplot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ggplot)

## [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)

Altair is a declarative statistical visualization python library based on Vega-lite. Declarative means you only need to mention the links between data columns to the encoding channels, such as x-axis, y-axis, color, etc. and the rest of the plotting details are handled automatically. Being declarative makes Altair simple, friendly and consistent. It is easy to design effective and beautiful visualizations with a minimal amount of code using Altair.


## [Geoplotlib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geoplotlib)

Geoplotlib is a toolbox used for plotting geographical data and map creation. It can be used to create a variety of map-types, like choropleths, heatmaps, and dot density maps. Pyglet (an object-oriented programming interface) is required to be installed to use Geoplotlib.

Geoplotlib reduces the complexity of designing visualizations by providing a set of in-built tools for the most common tasks such as density visualization, spatial graphs, and shape files.

Since most Python data visualization libraries don’t offer maps, it’s good to have a library dedicated to them.
